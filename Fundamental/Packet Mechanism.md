#### Packet Mechanism

Why package?

To distinguish class, which share same name. For example, when you got two class call "Demo01", but they belong to diff field (1st Demo01 for variable definition practice and 2nd Demo01 for loop practice). **In other word**, package looks like a folder!

You can use package like this way:

``` java
package pkg1[.pkg2[.pkag3...]];
```



#### Import 

You can import some package like this way:

``` java
import package1[.package2...].(classname|*);
import com.javapractice.base.* // * means that all of class of these package will be imported
```
